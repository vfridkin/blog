The ANZ jedi masters' bible is 'Lean Startup' - to me it is an application of the scientific method to building a business.  It mentions creating a minimum viable product (MVP), validating with potential customers, updating the MVP, validating again, then repeating as rapidly as possible.

To validate our Data2App, we cold called real world potential customers after running out of friends and family.

We hoped for this:

And achieved this:

These are the organisations we called:

- Adshel, Billboards Australia, Vodafone, Channel 9, Inspire9, La Trobe University, REA, Waste management, Melbourne University, Arcare, Australia Post, Penash Productions

Of those, we almost met with 

- Billboards Australia, Inspire9, La Trobe University

And we met, showed and gained feedback from

- Australia Post, Penash Productions

Which is a 17% conversion rate - which is comparable with the [average conversion rates for output phone sales of 15-20%](http://blog.voiq.com/the-average-conversion-rate-for-an-outbound-phone-sales-campaign).

For those we did meet with, we received useful feedback and validation including

Thank you to those companies that engaged with us.  For the others, call me back any time, Datathon 2019 is only a year away!
