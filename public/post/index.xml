      <description>Fleep is the new tinder for data scientists. After some online speed dataing a team was born. I showed my wife a list of names we&amp;rsquo;d come up with. The result of the vote is at the end of this post. Sorry Fleep, once we got serious it was time for Slack where we set up a channel called let&amp;rsquo;s do for voting using emojis. It&amp;rsquo;s a good way to keep trigger happy channel creators under control ðŸ˜Š.</description>

      <description>5:49 PM Fri, Phil: I&amp;rsquo;m just awaiting feedback from the final 2 judges&amp;hellip;
9:09 PM Fri, Phil: The finalists will be announced within the hour (hopefully)

Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea for the dataset to be used at next year&amp;rsquo;s datathon - the heart rate, blood pressure and other vital signs over the hours before and after the announcement of the finalists ðŸ˜….
The competition had two categories this year.</description>

      <description>The ANZ jedi mastersâ€™ bible is â€˜Lean Startupâ€™ - to me it is an application of the scientific method to building a business. It mentions creating a minimum viable product (MVP), validating with potential customers, updating the MVP, validating again, then repeating as rapidly as possible.
To validate our Data2App, we cold called real world potential customers after running out of friends and family.
We hoped for this:

      <description>Are you tough enough for this journey? Want stronger ABS? We added census data-packs to our lanky Data2App by visiting the 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics data packs website.
Itâ€™s like a candy store for data geeks. We picked four flavours
Plum AgeBlueberry StudentsMint IncomeMarmalade EmploymentWith these new flavours, users of our Data2App can cherry pick their stops according to passengers from neighbourhoods with above average age, higher proportions of students, higher income or higher rate of employment.</description>

      <description>Freebies are tempting. We considered using the free for a limited time Tableau. In my opinion though, R Shiny has three things that shone through
wealth of community packagesfree for an unlimited timerequires knowledge of R and codingPerhaps some people think the last point is a drawback - horses for courses. Thereâ€™s a more in depth comparison on homeagency
This was our first version on shinyapps.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier driving when you&amp;rsquo;re looking out the windscreen to see where you&amp;rsquo;re going. Two members of the Mathemagicians had previous experience and their advice was our windscreen.
 Data ingestion was a challenge
